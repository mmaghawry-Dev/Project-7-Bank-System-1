🏦 Bank System 1
📌 Project Overview

Bank System 1 is a console-based project developed as part of an advanced programming course.

In this course, we solved progressively challenging problems and then applied them to build this project.

The project demonstrates how theoretical problem-solving can be transformed into a practical system using clean and structured code.

--------------------
🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used

C++ Programming Language

Vectors for dynamic data storage

Structures for client representation

Enums for better readability and maintainability

Clean Code Principles

Problem Decomposition (building on previously solved exercises)

Incremental Development approach

---------------------

🚀 Features

Display all clients

Add new client

Delete existing client

Update client information

Find client by ID or name

(Optional) File storage for saving and loading client data

--------------------

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Strengthened problem-solving through practical application

Hands-on practice with advanced C++ concepts (vectors, structs, enums)

Gained experience in clean, modular, and maintainable code

Learned how to decompose complex problems into smaller, testable components
